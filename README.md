# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Labollo**, an aspiring game developer based in Italy.  
I design and build whatever I can imagine — if an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll bring it to life.

My main tech is **Lua** with **Love2D**, but I also have experience with **Angular**, **TypeScript/JavaScript**, and I've studied **Java** and **C**.

## Fun Facts
- I have two cats and one dog 🐱🐶
- Can't live without coffee ☕
- *My Hero Academia* is my favorite anime
- Hobbies: watching TV, going to the gym, coding
